Hello there! Starting off the summer by learning HTML and CSS, along with the many other languages that intermingle with these two foundational languages that have made this blog possible. Plan to learn more about Python, C, and the basics of coding, as I see this skillset as complimentary to my civil engineering background. This summer will be full of coding, but also full of outdoor excursions, food festivals, and educational adventures - can't wait for it all to begin!

Until the next post,
Lauren
